# Chess Java

<p>Since the third alpha, the game auto-ajust to closer resolution.
But if you cannot use this auto-ajust, you can choose any resolution.
So you choose the resolution you must write, for example:</p>

<p><code> java -jar Chess_alpha_3.java RESOLUTION </code></p>

Where <code>RESOLUTION</code> it's a number more than 200, and represents the pixels of the side board.
